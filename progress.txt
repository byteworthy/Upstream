## Iteration 3 - 2026-02-01T03:58:00Z
Story: #17 - Create test fixtures for automation models

### Implementation
- Added automation model fixtures to upstream/test_fixtures.py
- create_claim_score(): Creates ClaimScore with realistic default values
  - Configurable confidence metrics, risk scores, and automation tier
  - Auto-creates associated ClaimRecord if not provided
- create_automation_profile(): Creates CustomerAutomationProfile
  - Configurable tier thresholds (auto_execute, queue_review, escalate)
  - Shadow mode and notification settings
  - All action toggles properly defaulted
- create_shadow_result(): Creates ShadowModeResult
  - Links to ClaimScore (auto-created if needed)
  - Tracks AI vs human decision comparison
  - Configurable outcome classification

### Key Decisions
- Used method-style fixtures (create_*) matching existing TenantTestMixin pattern
- All methods accept **kwargs for flexible customization
- Auto-create dependencies (claim, user) when not provided
- Realistic default values based on the scoring service implementation

### Files Changed
- upstream/test_fixtures.py

### Quality Gates
- python manage.py check: PASSED
- python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run: PASSED

### Status
✅ Story #17 completed and ready for commit

## Iteration 4 - 2026-02-01T04:00:00Z
Story: #18 - Add admin interface for automation models

### Implementation
- Added admin classes for all three automation models to upstream/admin.py
- ClaimScoreAdmin:
  - list_display: id, claim, customer, overall_confidence, denial_risk_score, automation_tier, recommended_action, requires_human_review, created_at
  - list_filter: automation_tier, recommended_action, requires_human_review, customer, model_version
  - Fieldsets for organized form layout (Claim Info, Confidence Metrics, Risk Scores, etc.)
- CustomerAutomationProfileAdmin:
  - list_display: id, customer, automation_stage, shadow_mode_enabled, shadow_accuracy_rate, auto_submit_claims, created_at
  - 10 fieldsets for clear organization of tier thresholds
  - Searchable by customer name and notification email
- ShadowModeResultAdmin:
  - list_display: id, customer, claim_score, ai_recommended_action, ai_confidence, human_action_taken, actions_match, outcome, created_at
  - list_filter: actions_match, outcome (as per acceptance criteria)
  - date_hierarchy on created_at for temporal navigation

### Key Decisions
- Used fieldsets to organize complex models for better UX
- Added readonly_fields for computed/timestamp fields
- Enabled searching by related model fields (customer__name, etc.)

### Quality Gates
- python manage.py check: PASSED
- python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run: PASSED

### Status
✅ Story #18 completed

## Iteration 5 - 2026-02-01T04:05:00Z
Session continuation: Fixing test failures and completing remaining tasks

### Fixes Applied
1. **RiskScoringService Import Issue**
   - Import was missing from upstream/api/views.py (likely removed by linter)
   - Added: `from upstream.services.scoring import RiskScoringService`
   - Result: All ClaimScoreEndpoint tests now pass (5/5)

2. **Factory_boy Patterns Used** (upstream/tests/factories.py)
   - Added ClaimScoreFactory with traits: high_confidence, medium_confidence, low_confidence, red_line, fraud_risk
   - Added CustomerAutomationProfileFactory with traits: observe_stage, suggest_stage, act_notify_stage, full_autonomy_stage, conservative, aggressive
   - Added ShadowModeResultFactory with traits: agreement, ai_overconfident, ai_underconfident, human_more_cautious
   - Used LazyAttribute for computed fields (automation_tier, recommended_action derived from confidence)
   - Used SelfAttribute for customer inheritance from claim_score

### Tests Added
- 16 new factory tests in upstream/tests/test_factories.py
- Tests verify all traits work correctly
- Total: 48 factory tests (all pass)

### Key Learnings
- Linters can remove "unused" imports that are actually used at runtime
- factory_boy Params/Traits are powerful for test scenarios
- DRF ViewSet @action methods need explicit imports for all dependencies
- Customer inheritance via SelfAttribute: `customer=factory.SelfAttribute("..customer")`

### Quality Gates
- All 69 automation-related tests pass
- python manage.py check: PASSED
- Admin interface verified working

### Stories Completed This Session
- ✅ Story #16: API integration tests
- ✅ Story #17: Test fixtures for automation models
- ✅ Story #18: Admin interface for automation models

### Status
All Phase tasks complete. Ready for commit.
