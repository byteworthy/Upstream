## Iteration 5 - 2026-02-01 01:53 UTC
Story: #1 - Generate HIPAA BAA document template (Milestone 05)

### Implementation
- Created docs/legal/ directory structure
- Created comprehensive HIPAA Business Associate Agreement template
- Template location: docs/legal/baa_template.md (387 lines)
- Document structure:
  - Article 1: Definitions (HIPAA terms + AI/ML-specific)
  - Article 2: Obligations of Business Associate (permitted uses, prohibited uses, safeguards)
  - Article 3: Data Use Limitations (retention, geographic, segregation)
  - Article 4: AI/ML-Specific Provisions (model training, explainability, bias monitoring)
  - Article 5: Breach Notification (30-day BA notice, 60-day HIPAA compliance)
  - Article 6: Subcontractors
  - Article 7: Term and Termination
  - Article 8: Miscellaneous
  - Exhibits A-C: Services, Uses, Security Specifications

### Key Decisions
- Included AI-specific clauses for modern healthcare AI platform needs
- Model training restrictions require explicit written authorization
- Explainability requirements for clinical decision support systems
- Bias monitoring requirements for AI/ML outputs
- 30-day BA notification enables Covered Entity's 60-day HIPAA deadline

### Learnings
- HIPAA BAA must include standard clauses from 45 CFR 164.504(e)
- AI/ML provisions are increasingly important for healthcare SaaS
- Template includes placeholder fields for customization
- Legal review disclaimer added to template footer

### Status
✅ Story #1 complete and committed
✅ Quality gate passed (test -f docs/legal/baa_template.md)
