## Iteration 6 - 2026-02-01 02:05 UTC
Story: #2 - Create Security Whitepaper (Milestone 05)

### Implementation
- Created docs/security/ directory structure
- Created comprehensive Security Whitepaper
- Document location: docs/security/security_whitepaper.md (653 lines)
- Document structure (12 sections):
  1. Executive Summary
  2. Security Architecture Overview (defense in depth diagram)
  3. Data Encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
  4. Access Control and Authentication (RBAC, MFA, SSO)
  5. Audit Logging and Monitoring (comprehensive event logging)
  6. HIPAA Compliance (Administrative, Physical, Technical safeguards)
  7. SOC 2 Type II Readiness (all 5 Trust Service Criteria)
  8. Incident Response (severity classification, response process)
  9. Infrastructure Security (cloud, network, Kubernetes)
  10. Application Security (SDLC, OWASP Top 10)
  11. Third-Party Security (vendor management)
  12. Security Governance (organization, policies)

### Key Decisions
- Included detailed encryption specifications (AES-256-GCM, TLS 1.3 cipher suites)
- Documented both cloud provider options (AWS/GCP)
- Added ASCII diagrams for architecture visualization
- Included tables for easy scanning of security controls

### Learnings
- Security whitepapers should address both technical and compliance audiences
- SOC 2 Type II readiness is broader than just security (5 trust criteria)
- HIPAA safeguards map well to SOC 2 security controls

### Status
✅ Story #2 complete and committed
✅ Quality gate passed (test -f docs/security/security_whitepaper.md)
