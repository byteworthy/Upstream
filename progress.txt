## Iteration 6 - 2026-02-01 02:05 UTC
Story: #2 - Create Security Whitepaper (Milestone 05)

### Implementation
- Created docs/security/ directory structure
- Created comprehensive Security Whitepaper
- Document location: docs/security/security_whitepaper.md (653 lines)
- Document structure (12 sections):
  1. Executive Summary
  2. Security Architecture Overview (defense in depth diagram)
  3. Data Encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
  4. Access Control and Authentication (RBAC, MFA, SSO)
  5. Audit Logging and Monitoring (comprehensive event logging)
  6. HIPAA Compliance (Administrative, Physical, Technical safeguards)
  7. SOC 2 Type II Readiness (all 5 Trust Service Criteria)
  8. Incident Response (severity classification, response process)
  9. Infrastructure Security (cloud, network, Kubernetes)
  10. Application Security (SDLC, OWASP Top 10)
  11. Third-Party Security (vendor management)
  12. Security Governance (organization, policies)

### Key Decisions
- Included detailed encryption specifications (AES-256-GCM, TLS 1.3 cipher suites)
- Documented both cloud provider options (AWS/GCP)
- Added ASCII diagrams for architecture visualization
- Included tables for easy scanning of security controls

### Learnings
- Security whitepapers should address both technical and compliance audiences
- SOC 2 Type II readiness is broader than just security (5 trust criteria)
- HIPAA safeguards map well to SOC 2 security controls

### Status
✅ Story #2 complete and committed
✅ Quality gate passed (test -f docs/security/security_whitepaper.md)

## Iteration 7 - 2026-02-01 02:12 UTC
Story: #3 - Create vendor security questionnaire (Milestone 05)

### Implementation
- Vendor questionnaire already existed (created by parallel process)
- Verified all acceptance criteria sections present:
  - Company information
  - Data handling (encryption, retention, isolation)
  - Infrastructure security (cloud, network, vulnerability management)
  - Business continuity (DR plan, RTO/RPO, backup procedures)
  - Compliance certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001 plans)
  - Sub-processor list with data access levels
- Document location: docs/security/vendor_questionnaire.md (492 lines)

### Key Decisions
- Used existing questionnaire as it met all criteria
- Q&A format used for easy assessment completion

### Learnings
- Parallel milestone execution may create some files in advance
- Verify existing content meets acceptance criteria before recreating

### Status
✅ Story #3 complete and committed
✅ Quality gate passed (test -f docs/security/vendor_questionnaire.md)

## Iteration 8 - 2026-02-01 02:18 UTC
Story: #4 - Create production deployment checklist (Milestone 05)

### Implementation
- Created docs/deployment/ directory structure
- Created comprehensive production deployment checklist
- Document location: docs/deployment/production_checklist.md (614 lines)
- Document structure:
  - Pre-deployment checklist (code, build, change management)
  - Environment variables (all required vars with tables)
  - Database migrations (backup, execute, verify)
  - Static asset deployment (collectstatic, CDN)
  - DNS configuration (A, CNAME, TXT records)
  - SSL/TLS certificate setup (installation, verification)
  - Monitoring and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, logging)
  - Backup verification (database, storage, configuration)
  - Rollback procedure (immediate and database-level)
  - Post-deployment verification and sign-off

### Key Decisions
- Used checkbox format for actionable items
- Included code snippets for verification commands
- Added tables for environment variables with descriptions
- Included rollback decision criteria for quick reference

### Learnings
- Production checklists should be step-by-step executable
- Include both automated and manual verification steps
- Sign-off section provides audit trail for deployments

### Status
✅ Story #4 complete and committed
✅ Quality gate passed (test -f docs/deployment/production_checklist.md)
