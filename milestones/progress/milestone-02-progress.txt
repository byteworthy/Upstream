# Ralph Progress Log - Upstream Gaps Implementation
# Started: 2026-02-01
# Branch: ralph/upstream-gaps-sprint1

## Sprint Goals
1. RPA Framework (Stories 1-5): Mock payer portal automation
2. PT/OT G-Codes (Stories 6-12): Medicare G-code compliance
3. Home Health Cert Cycles (Stories 13-16): 60-day recertification tracking
4. Final Integration (Story 17): Full test suite validation

## Codebase Context
- Django 5.x with DRF
- Multi-tenant via CustomerScopedManager
- Alerts system in upstream/alerts/
- Existing patterns in upstream/products/dialysis/, upstream/products/aba/

## Key Patterns Discovered
- Models use CustomerScopedManager for tenant isolation
- Services are stateless, receive customer in constructor
- Tests use factories from upstream/tests/factories.py
- Alerts use AlertEvent model with evidence_payload JSONField
