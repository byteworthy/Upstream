# Upstream - Sales Overview

## What Upstream Does

Upstream detects when payers change their behavior—denying more claims, slowing payments, changing policies—within hours or days, not weeks. Then it handles the routine fixes automatically.

---

## The Problem You're Solving Right Now

You find out about payer problems too late:

- Denials spike but you don't know why until month-end
- A payer quietly changed documentation requirements—now 30% of claims are rejecting
- Medicare Advantage is paying 15% less than traditional Medicare, and it took 3 months to notice
- Authorizations expired and suddenly you can't bill for services already rendered
- Payments slowed from 45 days to 58 days and nobody caught it until cash flow got tight

**By the time you see it, you've already lost weeks of revenue.**

---

## How Upstream Works

### 1. Early Warning Detection (Hours/Days, Not Weeks)

We catch payer changes immediately:

| Situation | Traditional RCM | Upstream |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Authorization expires in 30 days | Find out after denial | Alert today, prevent denial later |
| Payer denial rate jumps | Month-end report | Alert within 24 hours |
| Payment timing slows 45→52 days | Notice when cash is tight | Detect trend within 3 days |
| Missing required modifier | Denial after submission | Flag before submission |

### 2. Autonomous Execution (No Waiting)

We don't just alert you—we handle it:

- **Authorization expiring?** We auto-submit the reauth request same day
- **Claim underpaid $500?** We auto-generate and submit the appeal within 4 hours
- **Missing required modifier?** We add it before the claim goes out
- **High-risk claim?** We flag it for your review before submission

You get a summary: *"We submitted 3 reauth requests, appealed 5 underpayments, and flagged 2 claims for review."*

Not: *"Here are 47 tasks you need to do."*

### 3. Specialty-Specific Intelligence

#### For Dialysis Centers
- Track Medicare Advantage payment variance (alerts when MA pays <85% of traditional Medicare)
- Monitor ESRD PPS bundle payment changes
- Detect TDAPA/TPNIES add-on payment issues
- Quantify revenue impact: "$8,400/month lost to MA variance"

#### For ABA Therapy Practices
- 30-day authorization expiration alerts (prevent the #1 cause of denials)
- Track visit consumption vs authorized units
- Payer-specific reauth deadlines (21 days for BCBS, 14 days for Aetna, etc.)
- BCBA credential expiration tracking

#### For Imaging Centers
- Prior authorization tracking by RBM (eviCore, AIM, etc.)
- Medical necessity documentation scoring
- CMS Appropriate Use Criteria compliance
- PA requirement database by payer + procedure

#### For Home Health Agencies
- PDGM grouper validation before submission
- Face-to-Face documentation deadline tracking
- OASIS completion monitoring
- NOA submission timing optimization

## The Speed Advantage

```
Traditional RCM:
Payer changes behavior → 30 days until month-end report → You find out → Start fixing

Upstream:
Payer changes behavior → 24-72 hours → You know → System already fixing
```

**That's 25+ days of advance warning. Every single time.**

---

## The Bottom Line

You're running blind right now. Payer problems are happening today that you won't see until next month's reports.

**Upstream flips the timeline:**

- See problems days earlier, not weeks
- First alerts within 48 hours of setup
- Prevent denials before submission
- Recover underpayments automatically within hours
- Stop surprises from becoming crises
